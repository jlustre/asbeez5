## 2. Guiding Principles for Investor Structures

1. **Capital Protection First**  
   Investors should recover capital early through structured returns.

2. **Cash Flow + Asset Backing**  
   Returns are supported by:
   - daily-need retail cash flow
   - rental income
   - agriculture production
   - real property assets

3. **Founder–Investor Alignment**  
   The founder remains heavily invested in operations and long-term growth.

4. **Scalability**  
   Structures must support:
   - expansion
   - franchising
   - reinvestment without constant renegotiation

## 3. Model A: Silent Investor (Preferred Return)

### Overview
Best for investors who want:
- predictable income
- minimal involvement
- priority returns before profit sharing

### Structure
- Investor provides capital
- No operational role
- No day-to-day decision-making

### Return Mechanics
1. **Preferred Return:** 12–15% per year (paid from net profits)
2. **Capital Recovery:** Paid back from cash flow
3. **Excess Profits:** Shared after preferred return is met

### Example (₱10M Investment)
- Preferred return: ₱1.2M–₱1.5M annually
- Capital returned over ~24 months
- After capital recovery:
  - Investor receives 30–40% of net profits
  - Founder retains majority

### Best For
- Conservative investors
- Family offices
- Capital preservation-focused partners

---

## 4. Model B: Equity Partner (Proportional Ownership)

### Overview
Best for investors who want:
- direct ownership
- upside from growth
- long-term participation

### Structure
- Investor receives equity shares in AsBeez Holding Company
- Ownership based on valuation at entry

### Example
- Pre-money valuation: ₱50M
- Investor invests ₱10M
- Ownership: 16.7%

### Returns
- Share of annual profits (dividends)
- Share of asset appreciation
- Participation in exit events

### Considerations
- Dividends may be reinvested in early years
- Higher upside, higher exposure

---

## 5. Model C: Joint Venture (Project-Level)

### Overview
Best for:
- site-specific investments
- asset-backed ventures
- clear boundaries (e.g., one farm, one apartment building)

### Structure
- Separate SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)
- Profits shared based on capital contribution
- Assets ring-fenced

### Example: Apartment JV
- Investor funds 70% of build cost
- Founder funds 30%
- Net rental income split 70/30
- Exit via sale or buyout clause after Year 5

### Benefits
- Lower risk through asset specificity
- Clear exit paths

---

## 6. Model D: Convertible Investment (Growth-Focused)

### Overview
Best for early-stage investors who want:
- downside protection
- upside equity optionality

### Structure
- Investor provides convertible note
- Fixed return until conversion
- Converts to equity upon trigger event

### Typical Terms
- Annual return: 8–10%
- Conversion discount: 20–30%
- Valuation cap agreed upfront

### Conversion Triggers
- Franchise rollout
- Second/third branch opening
- External funding round

---

## 7. Model E: Hybrid (Preferred Return + Equity Kicker)

### Overview
Most balanced option.

### Structure
- Investor receives:
  - preferred annual return
  - smaller equity stake

### Example (₱10M Investment)
- Preferred return: 10%
- Capital returned over 24 months
- Equity kicker: 10–15% ownership

### Result
- Early income
- Long-term upside
- Strong alignment

---

## 8. Profit Distribution Policy (Group-Level)

### Net Profit Allocation (Suggested)
- 40% distributed to investors (dividends / profit share)
- 40% retained for expansion and reserves
- 20% founder compensation and incentives

This policy can be adjusted by board resolution.

## 9. Role of ALRS in Investor Returns

ALRS directly enhances investor outcomes by:
- increasing customer lifetime value
- stabilizing cash flow
- reducing marketing spend
- accelerating revenue ramp-up for new branches
- supporting franchising scalability

ALRS is a **competitive moat**, not a cost center.

---

## 10. Exit Options for Investors

- Dividend income (long-term hold)
- Buy-back by founder/company
- Sale of assets (property, farm)
- Franchise royalty income
- Strategic acquisition

Exit terms can be pre-defined in shareholder or JV agreements.

---

## 11. Risk & Governance Safeguards

- Board or advisory seat (for major investors)
- Quarterly financial reporting
- External audit (annual)
- Major decisions require investor consent (as defined)

---

## 12. Summary for Investors

AsBeez offers:
- flexible entry structures
- strong cash flow
- asset-backed security
- proprietary loyalty-driven growth
- multiple exit pathways

Investor participation can be tailored without compromising operational integrity.
