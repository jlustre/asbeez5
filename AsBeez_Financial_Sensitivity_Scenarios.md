## 7. Role of ALRS in Upside Scenarios

ALRS is the **primary driver** moving results from conservative → base → aggressive:

- Increased visit frequency
- Customers “consolidate” spending into AsBeez
- Cross-business utilization (grocery → bakery → fastfood)
- Long-term stickiness through ARC unlocking
- Lower marketing spend due to built-in loyalty

Without ALRS:
- More price competition
- Higher churn
- Lower lifetime value

With ALRS:
- Predictable revenue growth
- Organic scaling

## 8. Downside Protection

AsBeez is designed to protect capital:
- Daily-need products reduce demand volatility
- Multiple independent revenue streams
- Real assets (property, farm)
- Rewards limited to profit margins
- No cash payouts
- Ability to pause or tune reward parameters

---

## 9. Investor Takeaway

- Conservative case still generates strong cash flow
- Base case offers compelling risk-adjusted returns
- Aggressive case shows platform-level upside
- ALRS meaningfully improves outcomes without increasing risk
