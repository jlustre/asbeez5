## Slide-by-Slide Content Outline (10–12 Slides)

## Slide 1 – Cover
**AsBeez Group**  
Integrated Retail, Food, Property & Agriculture  
Powered by the **AsBeez Loyalty Reward System (ALRS)**

*Everyday essentials. Repeat customers. Sustainable rewards.*

---

## Slide 2 – The Opportunity
### A Daily-Needs Business With Built-In Loyalty
- Filipinos spend daily on food, groceries, rice, and meals
- Most small retailers compete only on price
- Loyalty programs are fragmented, expensive, or unsustainable
- Investors want:
  - Predictable cash flow
  - Asset-backed businesses
  - Scalable growth

**AsBeez combines all three.**

---

## Slide 3 – The AsBeez Solution
### A Vertically Integrated Ecosystem
AsBeez operates multiple essential businesses:
- Grocery
- Bakery
- Fastfood
- Rice Retail
- Apartments (rental income)
- Poultry Farms (egg production)

All unified by **one loyalty system** that increases customer lifetime value.

## Slide 4 – What Makes AsBeez Different
### Not Just Another Retail Store
- Multiple revenue streams under one group
- High-frequency customer visits
- Vertical integration (farm → store → food)
- Proprietary loyalty engine (**ALRS**)
- Rewards funded by real profit, not marketing spend

---

## Slide 5 – AsBeez Loyalty Reward System (ALRS)
### Loyalty Without Subscriptions or Recruiting
- Customers earn **Qualified Points (QBP)** from purchases
- Every 100 QBP unlocks a **Reward Cell (ARC)**
- ARCs participate in community rewards
- Rewards are **store credit only**
- No sign-up fees, no subscriptions, no recruiting

This drives **repeat spending across all AsBeez brands**.

---

## Slide 6 – Why ALRS Works (Investor View)
- Profit-funded rewards (10% of margin only)
- No rewards on store-credit spending (prevents loops)
- Unused rewards fund platform operations

**Lower CAC. Higher LTV. Sustainable economics.**
